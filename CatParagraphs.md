Judy - Judy Pizarro - Hello, I'm Judy.  I'm 4.5 years old and originally from the Carribean. I grew tired of the heat and humidity, so I decided to give the Northwest a try.  I love playing hide and seek, but really prefer to hide.  I'm currently working as a stagehand and have a passion for shakespeare. 
Romy - Romy Manchegin - Oi, I'm Romy.  I'm 8.25 years old, but feel like I'm only 1.  I have a thirst for life, and was previously a world class boxer, but gave it all up to pursue my true love of fishing.  Most weekends I'm out on my boat or at the piers, and during the week, I'm tending bar at the hottest catnip bar in town. 
Taz - Taz Pierce - Hello, I'm Taz.  I'm 1.5 years old, and have lived all over the world.  My mother was an airline pilot, and she loved to take me wherever she went.  I'm currently in flight school, and slowly making my way to be able to sit in the pilots seat.  One day I hope to be able to own my own plane and live on an island in the pacific. 
Twizzers - Twizzers Sporzan - Hey!  I'm twizzers and I'm 9 years old. I love learning, and growing.  By day, I work as a chemist creating cures for the common cold.  By night, I move through the city with a group doing parkour, and inspiring youth to get outside.  I'm here to meet someone that makes me flip with excitement. 
Crumpet - Crumpet Smith - Hello there, I'm Crumpet.  I'm .75 years old, and still learning a lot about life. I'm currently in my "just sort of figuring it out" stage of life, and I'm here mainly for friends.  I work as a stock associate at a florist, and am going to CIT next year to study medicinal catnip use to help with anxiety.
